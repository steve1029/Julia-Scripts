# pycuda_prac
It contains the codes for testing the pycuda package, to determine the future usage for my research.
At first, I was intended to use pycuda.
I started to practice how to use pycuda to accelerate the simulation.
Then later I found 'cupy', a more readable and convenient package for using the GPGPU in python environment.
So I transferred from pycuda to cupy.
So this directory is a remnant of my earlier research and has been abandoned now.
